                    While using the Pomodoro Method, make sure to avoid any
                    outside distractions. One of the primary concepts in the
                    Pomodoro Method is avoiding distractions during your work

                    It can be helpful to break down larger tasks into subtasks
                    that are more manageable. This can make tasks less daunting
                    and allow you to work more efficiently.{" "}

                    Students on average perform better in logical classes such
                    as math and engineering in the morning and better at
                    analytical classes such as languages and social sciences in
                    the afternoon. Using this to make a schedule can help
                    significantly in the learning process.

                  The Pomodoro Method has been scientifically proven to improve
                  productivity by allowing users to regularly take breaks and
                  relax their minds. It is encouraged to break down larger
                  projects and work on separate aspects each loop. Every 4th
                  break is extended in order to give the user a reward for hard
                  work.
